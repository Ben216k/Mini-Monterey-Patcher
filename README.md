# Mini Monterey Patcher

A mini patcher for macOS Monterey by Ben Sova.

## Wait, where's the UI?!

**This in no way is the squal to Patched Sur.** This will only be a terminal-based patcher (coming sometime this week).

**I have this so I can play with Monterey without building a full UI patcher.** Which will come out before the full release of Monterey with many previews and betas along the way.

So yeah... that's what this will be. Monterey, here we come!

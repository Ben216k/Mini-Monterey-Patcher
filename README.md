# Mini Monterey Patcher

A mini patcher for macOS Monterey by Ben Sova.

This in no way is the squal to Patched Sur. This will only be a terminal-based patcher (coming sometime this week).

I have this so I can play with Monterey without building a full UI patcher.

So yeah... that's what this will be. Monterey, here we come!
